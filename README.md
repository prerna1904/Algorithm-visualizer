Simplified Algorithm Learning Through Visualization is an interactive educational project designed to make algorithm learning easier, clearer, and more engaging through visual representation.

Many students find algorithms difficult because they are often taught theoretically or through large blocks of complex code. Instead of understanding the logic, students tend to memorize the code patterns without truly grasping how the algorithm works internally.

This project addresses that challenge by:
	•	Breaking down large and complex algorithms into smaller, understandable steps
	•	Dividing lengthy code into logical segments
	•	Visually representing each step of execution
	•	Showing how data changes at every stage

Through visualization, learners can clearly see how an algorithm progresses from input to output. Rather than memorizing code syntax, students understand:
	•	Why each step is performed
	•	How comparisons and swaps happen
	•	How decisions are made inside loops and conditions
	•	How the overall logic builds gradually
